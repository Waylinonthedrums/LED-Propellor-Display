# LED-Propellor-Display

This repository includes 2 variations to implement a display of uppercase letters and space with an array of 8 LEDs on a rotating fan blade. The first option depends on the physical setup and fan speed to determine the estimated rotation time. The second option (sensor) uses a magnetic sensor to synchronize the varying rotation speed of the fan, resulting in a consistant location for the display. 

Example with magnetic sensor syncronization option
